# fp-note-spheres
A first-person Unity project where a player can create music by controlling bouncing spheres in a number of ways. Each sphere represents a note within a given scale. Multiple spheres can be spawned at once (chords) and their rate of play is defined by bounce controls. They can be despawned and retriggered in various ways.
